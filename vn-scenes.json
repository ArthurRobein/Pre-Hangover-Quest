    "la Jetee" : [
	"your here in the narrow street of the port
you can sees docked ships charging and discharging they container
tier sailor walking searching for a place to spend time
while your here spending your time watching them, an image that remember
you an  era, where with your father you was watching boat coming in and out",
	"advancing on your way walking along dark alley, and street
you saw a light in the distance,
not a plain light as you can see from a building
but something that seems to be a mix of colors,
and as you go that direction
noise seems to confirm you suspicion",
	"you finally reach the source of this unusual meeting,
a lot of peoples on the seafront, surrounding a 'jetee' of the port,
in the middle of these peoples: a dead man lying on the street
and among the faces, one seems particularly expressive:
an horrified sad woman watching him, hoping to wake up from a dream
but you can wake up from reality",
 	"someday ... I'll finish this scene, add events, and make it a one time even
Introduce some characters too :)
