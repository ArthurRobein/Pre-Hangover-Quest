    "la Jetee" : [
	"your here in the narow streat of the port
you can sees docked ships charging and dicharging they container
tier sailor walking searching for a place to spend time
while your here spending your time watching them, an image that remember
you an  era, where with your father you was watching boat comming in and out",
	"advancing on your way walking along dark alley, and street
you saw a light in the distance,
not a plain light as you can see from a building
but something that seems to be a mix of colors,
and as you go that direction
noise seems to confirme you suspision",
	"you finally reachthe source of this unusual meeting,
a lot of peoples on the seefront, sourounding a 'jetee' of the port,
in the middle of thers peoples: a dead man lying on the street
and amoung the faces, one seems particulary expresive:
an horified sad woman watching him, hoping to wake up from a dream
but you can wake up from reality"
