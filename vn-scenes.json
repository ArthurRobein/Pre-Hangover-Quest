you can sees docked ships charging and discharging they container

while your here spending your time watching them, an image that remember
you an  era, where with your father you was watching boat coming in and out",

you saw a light in the distance,
not a plain light as you can see from a building
but something that seems to be a mix of colors,
and as you go that direction
noise seems to confirm you suspicion",

a lot of peoples on the seafront, surrounding a 'jetee' of the port,
in the middle of these peoples: a dead man lying on the street
and among the faces, one seems particularly expressive:
an horrified sad woman watching him, hoping to wake up from a dream
but you can wake up from reality",

Introduce some characters too :)
